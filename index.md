This workshop is an introduction to parallel programming in Chapel. This
material is designed for Day 2 of HPC Carpentry.

By the end of this workshop, students will know:

* the basic syntax of Chapel codes,
* how to run single-locale Chapel codes,
* how to write task-parallel codes for a shared-memory compute node,
* how to run multi-locale Chapel codes,
* how to write domain-parallel codes for a distributed-memory cluster.

**NOTE: This is the draft HPC Carpentry release. Comments and feedback are
welcome.**

> ## Prerequisites
>
> There are no real prerequisites for this lesson, but prior programming and/or
> command line experience will be helpful. This lesson assumes no previous
> knowledge of parallel programming.
